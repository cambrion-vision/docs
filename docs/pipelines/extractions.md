# Create pipelines

In order to extract information from your documents you have to create a pipeline that performs the required processing steps. The task of creating a pipeline becomes very simple when using the extraction API. An extraction is a data structure that contains descriptions of the information to be extracted in natural language and incorporates those descriptions to generate a pipeline. The generated pipeline can then be used as described in [pipeline](./pipeline).

## The structure of an extraction

An extraction contains fields, tables and key value sets which define the data structures you want to extract from the document. These can be arbitrarily combined and nested. This allows extracting highly complex data structures from documents without ever incorporating any document formatting explicitly or training a model.
