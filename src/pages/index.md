# ***<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>Build and deploy custom document extraction APIs with Cambrion</p>***

Extracting information from documents is a tedious and error-prone process. It becomes even more complicated and costly when you have custom requirements that exceed of the shelf offerings. At Cambrion we set out to provide a solution that enables custom, low-cost document extraction workflows that can be consumed by a [standardized API](/api).

## Features

- Create and deploy custom models at low cost
- Build complex extraction workflows
- Add your own logic via python code
- Link and compare business data to document contents
- Map document contents to business objects

## Development stage

Currently we are in close collaboration with a number of hand-picked initial customers to validate use-cases and iterate on the product. This means that some features of the API are not public yet.
